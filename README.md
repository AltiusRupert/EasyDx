# EasyDx - Salesforce DX GUI Version
Salesforce DX CLI tool is great. But not everybody likes command lines. Plus, sometimes it is just tedious to remember and type those long lines of commands. 

So I have written this simple GUI version of Salesforce DX to help getting our daily work with Salesforce DX easier. The code is written in React, Node and Express. 

## Installation

> Before installing Easy DX, you need to install [Salesforce CLI Tool] (https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/sfdxcli) and [Node JS] (https://nodejs.org/en/). 

Download a .zip file of this repository to your local computer and unzip the files. 

In that folder, via command line, run 
```shell
npm install.
``` 

Once it is completed, you are ready to go! 

## Usage

In command line, go to your folder and run 
```shell
npm start
```

Then in your favourite browser, open this url: http://localhost:3666

Easy DX's UI is pretty self-explanatory. For further usage, I will post on my blog: sfdcinpractice.com 

Please note that Easy DX is still at Alpha stage for now. I am still actively working on pushing more features into it.
